# Discordantiphishing
 A Discord bot agains phishing
 It uses google safe borwsing https://safebrowsing.google.com
 and https://github.com/Dogino/Discord-Phishing-URLs/tree/main 
 as its database to determin if a link is a phishing link or not.

 I am planing on adding Phishtank.org as a database to but not right now
 (it gave me headachs when i first started this project)

 And again big thanks to @Dogino and his Phishing-Url list with out it
 this bot wouldnt get new phsihing links targetting discord

 tracking channel is set via the !set_tracking_channel "id" command
 working on making it a slash command
